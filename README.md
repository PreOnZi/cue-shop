This is the most direct way to finish the entire story.
There are however things to explore, mostly consisiting of various P5 sketches about the place.
They generally relate to what it says on the access button and are also loosely connected to the storyline.
Each project has a unique description and much of the experience relies on reading alerts and notifications in their entirity.
