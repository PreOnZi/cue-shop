              Speaking of your address. You know you gave me that, right? Your

              But I also took your live location ('google_updater.txt' wherever
              your files download to and also on the map bellow). Cute. Why
              wouldn't you want things delivered right to you? What are you
              hiding? I know you haven't been home for a few days.

              and again. Not only your picture, your voice or your location. You
              allowed me to gather it all, send it and do more than just that.
              Remember the plugin I asked you to download? Aren't you a bit old
              to be this vain?

            There is much more your data can be used for - it goes beyond
            advertising. Your data knows about you more than you do. It's the
            most precious and the easiest to give away.
