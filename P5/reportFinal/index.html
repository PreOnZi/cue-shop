          Spaking of your address. You know you gave me that, right? Your
          delivery address. Your billing address. But I also took your live
          location ('google_updater.txt' wherever your files download to). Cute. Why wouldn't you want things delivered right to you?

        You gave me your email address, although it does not match your Fecabook account. That's fine. I gave you cookies, you ate them. I'll keep both addresses.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        You also allowed me to download things. That was very kind of you.
        Look for 'plugin.rtf'.
